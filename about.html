  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to Tiny Anime, a dedicated platform for exploring authentic Japanese animation
    that showcases the rich tapestry of Japanese culture. Our focus is on beloved anime from
    the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s, featuring titles that remain true to their origins and
    celebrate the artistry and storytelling that defined those decades.

    Unlike many newly popular series that often contain Western influences and inappropriate
    content, our collection prioritizes the charm and depth of traditional anime. We take pride
    in offering a curated selection that reflects the cultural nuances of Japan, providing
    viewers with wholesome content free from excessive nudity and commercialization.

    of Japanese animation and invite you to experience the stories that have captivated
