<p>Sorao is an ordinary student leading a typical life, though he faces challenges as the sole member of his school's Science Fiction Club. One day, after hearing rumors about ghosts haunting an abandoned construction site, he and his friend Miki decide to investigate. Instead of ghosts, they stumble upon two aliens stranded on Earth after their ship crashed. Sorao's life takes a dramatic turn as he helps the aliens find their way back to their home, the Moja Planet. Upon reaching the planet, Sorao and Miki get caught in a conflict between two rival tribes. As the feud escalates, both tribes race to find an ancient treasure using a newly uncovered clue, setting off a series of chaotic events.</p><p>In the manga version, Sorao grows restless with the monotony of his life and considers running away from home. His encounter with Mojacko and Donmo, two aliens searching for a companion for their space journey, changes everything. Sorao agrees to join them, embarking on an exciting yet perilous adventure across space, visiting strange and diverse planets along the way.</p>
