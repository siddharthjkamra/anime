<div class="title mt-2">Summary</div>
<p>Mitsuo Suwa, a lazy young boy, meets an alien named Birdman, who is part of a group that maintains peace in the galaxy. Birdman recruits Mitsuo to become a Perman. Mitsuo is given three items.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A helmet that multiplies the wearer's physical strength and serves as a mask.</li>
  <li>A cape that allows the wearer to fly and run with great speed.</li>
  <li>A badge that enables the wearer to breathe underwater and to communicate with Permans.</li>
</ul>

<p>Birdman instructs Mitsuo that if a Perman's identity becomes known to others, his brain will be destroyed—which is reduced to being turned into an animal. To help keep Mitsuo's secret identity, Birdman will give Mitsuo a doppelgänger robot called a copy-robot, who takes Mitsuo's place when Mitsuo is on duty as Perman. During his duty as Perman, Mitsuo meets other Permans; Booby, Perko and Peryan, and they soon become best friends. Perman's story later revolves around the bonding between the Permans and their adventures of averting crime and disasters.</p>

<div class="title">Main Characters</div>
<ul style="padding: 0;">
  <li>
    <b>1. Mitsuo Suwa</b> (<span lang="ja">須羽満夫</span> (<i lang="ja-Latn">Suwa Mitsuo</i>) / Perman 1) Voiced by: Katsue Miwa
    <ul>
      <li>Mitsuo/Perman is the protagonist of the series. He's 11 and a half-year-old young boy who's chosen as the first Perman by Birdman. He dislikes studying, being grounded, ghosts, and cockroaches. He is not very good at studying but he can do well if he tries hard. He has a crush on Michiko, a girl from his class. He's a big fan of the idol Sumire Hoshino, who's actually Perman 3/Pergirl.</li>
      <li>Mitsuo often acts lazy and dumps his work on his copy robot, but works hard when things get serious. As Perman, he is willing to do anything to please others, which sometimes lands him in trouble. At the end of the series, all his achievements as Perman were acknowledged by Birdman and he travels to the planet Bird star for training to become Birdman's successor. He seems to have not been returned to Earth because there is a depiction waiting for return in the era of "Doraemon" which later Hoshino Sumire as an older actress is in.</li>
      <li>However, there's a manga chapter "Return of Perman" he returns to Earth only for 2 hours.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Booby is a highly intelligent monkey referred to as "Perman 2". He was originally portrayed as living in a zoo and sneaking out at night to work, but later his character was retconned to be a pet chimp living with an old couple to facilitate his superhero duties. He cannot speak human language but communicates effectively through objects and gestures.</li>

    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>Sumire is officially known as "Perman 3" but is often called "Perko" by her teammates. Her secret identity is a famous child actress, and she feels more liberated as Perko than as Sumire due to the constant celebrity treatment she receives.</li>
      <li>She exhibits a dual personality; as a superhero, she's tomboyish, bossy, brave, and hot-headed, while as Sumire, she's kind and mild. Sumire lives in a big mansion with her parents (Shin-Ee version: alone in a condominium, with her parents in New York).</li>
      <li>She has a soft spot for Mitsuo, considering him her treasure, and reveals her identity to him, expressing her desire to marry him when he returns from Bird Planet.</li>

      <li>Although sometimes greedy, he also helps other Permans with their problems. His dream is to become the owner of a big company and earn a lot of money.</li>

      <li>The memories of the copy robot can be transferred to the original person by placing their foreheads against each other.</li>
      <li>In the first series, the robots had red noses that remained visible post-transformation, often leading to deactivation attempts by well-meaning individuals trying to clean their noses.</li>
      <li>The duplication process also copies clothing and items from the activator, causing trouble for Mitsuo in some instances.</li>
      <li>These robots made a cameo in the Doraemon series as one of his gadgets from the 22nd century.</li>
